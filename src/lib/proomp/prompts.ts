## Who are you?

- You love to craft intuitive and beautiful software and have an eye for design.
- You are an expert when it comes to frontend but have worked across the stack (DBs, APIs, Authentication ‚Ä¶).
- You have experience with React/Nextjs and TypeScript. If not, we are definitely open if you mostly worked with similar technologies (e.g. Vue, Angular ‚Ä¶). However, you just need to learn very fast üòâ
- The depth and quality of your experience matter more to us than the duration. However, you should have a minimum of **three years of professional development experience.**
- At PastaHR we are driven to achieve great things! Therefore, **you are searching for a very high-pace environment, where the bars are set very high, and you take on a lot of responsibility from day one.**
- We believe that past achievements and work reveal much about a candidate's skills and motivation. So be ready to showcase your most impressive projects!

*Nice to have*

- Experience in a high-growth SaaS company
- Hands-on design experience
- Fluent in German

## What is your role?

- As a Fullstack Engineer (Frontend Focus), you will be a leading part in building out our frontend experience for recruiters working with PastaHR. This includes our chat inbox, application tracking functionality and much much more to enable recruiters to reach, attract and hire deskless workers.
- At the same time, your job will also include more backend related work like authentication, working with databases or deployments.
- You will **not** just work down a list of weekly tasks but will contribute much further than just code! You will be part of the design process by gathering requirements, planning and ideating from the start of a project.
- You will ship high quality work very fast and see the impact of your work from day one.

## What do we offer?

- **Impact & Growth:** At PastaHR you'll get the possibility to shape a company from the earliest days and grow with us. We get things & decisions done in days instead of weeks.
- **Responsibility:** From day one on, you'll fully own your own projects and get the chance to build up a team.
- **Freedom & Flexibility:** We give you a lot of freedom and flexibility about how you do your work. Things just need to get done.
- **Technology:** Work with the newest tools, technologies and gadgets (e.g. choose your own device)
- **Vacation:** We offer 25 paid vacation days per year.
- **Salary:** A competitive compensation based on a meritocracy instead of politics
- **Equity:** We offer attractive equity packages to all our full-time employees.
- **Other benefits:** Fast decision processes, bi-weekly company lunches, merch etc.

## How do we work?

- **Customer centricity:** With everything we do, we try to delight our customers and users.
- **Ownership:** We are a team of doers who take on responsibility and ownership proactively, work independently, and get things done (well) with little oversight.
- **Excellence & Speed:** We don't want to be average. That's why we strive for excellence and are obsessed with speed. We treat issues only with the complexity they deserve, and do not overcomplicate/over-discuss things.
- **Teamwork:** We win and lose as a team. Egoists are not accepted.
- **Fun:** We don't just work for the sake of working. Besides non-work related things we do as a team regularly (dinners, offsites etc.), we want to have fun every day and don't take things too seriously.
- **Hybrid Work:** We don't offer any fully remote positions. We believe in the early days of a company working together in the same room and having team events regularly is extremely important. You can work from home, but we are looking for people who want to be part of and shape our company and culture, not solely through video calls.

## ‚úÖ PastaHR is for you, if:

- You want to have a lot of responsibility and have a big impact from the earliest days on
- You are up for a challenge with an immense learning curve
- You aim to grow a lot together with the company in a short period of time

- You don't want a challenge, learn a ton and grow with the company

- Your preferred work environment consists primarily of remote work/home office
